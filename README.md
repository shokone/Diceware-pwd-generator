# Diceware-pwd-generator

[Diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) pwd generator is a method used to generate cryptographically strong passphrases.
This tool is a python implementation of the diceware algorithm.


## How Diceware PWD Generator Generate Passwords?

Traditional Diceware uses rolls of physical dice, this application uses a strong random number generator in place of the dice. 
A virtual dice is roled 5 times, and the 5 digit number used against a lookup [table of words](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt). 
6 dice rolls gives you 6 random words which are easy for a human being to remember, yet have a high amount of entropy which makes them hard to crack.

__WARNING__ : [Using a computer to generate your passphrases is not as secure as rolling physical die with a paper reference of the diceware list.](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#:~:text=Generating%20truly%20random%20numbers%20using%20a,better%20way%20to%20select%20passphrase%20words.)
